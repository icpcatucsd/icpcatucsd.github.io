# Training Resources

Below are some resources for learning and practicing competitive programming.

## Educational Resources

- **UCSD Courses**: [CSE 109 (Introduction to Programming Contests)](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/teaching/2022-spring-CSE109) and
  [CSE 190 (Introduction to Competitive Algorithmic Programming)](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/2020-winter-CSE190-CAP).
- [Competitive Programming book](https://cpbook.net/): The newer editions are
  available for purchase and the 1st edition is available as a PDF
  [here](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/myteaching/competitive_programming/cp1.pdf).
- [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/): A website that contains dozens of implementations of useful algorithms.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/): This site provides lots of information on common algorithms.

## Competition/Practice Sites

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com): This is one of the most famous competitive programming websites.
  You can participate in online competitions, solve problems from a huge problem bank, and learn from blogs and website solutions. A few of our favorites are
   [1](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/57282) and [2](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55274).
- [VJudge](https://vjudge.net/): An online judge platform where you can participate in programming competitions by submitting problems to various other platforms. **We also hold our weekly contests on VJudge**
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) hosts several official contests (you can find many regionals and world finals here).
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) Code-Chef is an online educational program and competitive programming community of global programmers.
